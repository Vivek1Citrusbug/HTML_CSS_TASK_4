                <p class="about-text">Welcome to <span class="Ondervisningsplan">Ondervisningsplan</span> , a content platform for teachers and pedagogues all over the country. Our vision is to strengthen teaching in Norwegian primary schools through access to quality resources and support for planning and implementation of teaching.
                    <br> The idea for Ondervisningsplan came when the founder, Karen Wiik, worked as a teacher. She noticed how talented colleagues created great commitment and enthusiasm in their students with teaching plans produced entirely without a textbook. At the same time, she also saw that there was no structured system that easily allowed the teachers to benefit from each other's good and creative teaching plans. Thus began the journey towards the establishment of <span class="Ondervisningsplan">Undervisningsplan.no</span>.
                    The teaching plan was launched in the autumn of 2021, and today has 13,000 registered users and an ever-increasing teaching bank covering over 2,000 teaching hours. We who work on the development of the Curriculum are Karen Wiik and Tonje Brattås, two committed and experienced teachers with a combined total of over 15 years of teaching experience in primary schools. Both are trained teachers with specialization in various fields.
